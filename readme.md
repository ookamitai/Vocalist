## Quick start
This project is under the `MUGA Project` (make UTAU great again).
Other documentation will be available once the project is more polished.

## Todo
- Add `AuditView` for viewing all your audio files at once
- Fix `Recording` bug
- Add spectrogram
- Add live recording waveform display
- May integrate into `Playwright`, but this will only happen when `Playwright` is partially complete.
